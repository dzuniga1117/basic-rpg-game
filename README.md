# basic-rpg-game
Basic RPG game with a little bit of experimentation with type matchups and info storage (very much a side project!)

# Files:
- rpgBase.py holds class definitions for character entities and parser for .xml documents holding type matchups, etc.
- rpgCharData.xml holds data for the main characters of the RPG
- rpgData.xml holds data for the attacks and element type matchups
